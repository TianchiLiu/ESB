## How to verify

We have tested verification with the following setup:

- Linux Ubuntu 17.10
- LLVM 5.0.0
- Z3 4.5.0
- Python 2.7.10

`make hv6-verify`:
    Runs the verification scripts for the hv6 kernel. This includes building the kernel
    into LLVM IR, translating the kernel to Python using Irpy, and invoking `hv6/spec/main.py`.
    Individual tests can be run, for example, to run just the `sys_set_runnable` test, inv`oke:
    `make hv6-verify -- -v --failfast HV6.test_sys_set_runnable`

`make irpy/test`:
    Runs the Irpy test suite, which compares symbolic execution results to running the C code
    directly.



## Directory structure

`hv6/`:
    Contains the implementation of the hv6 kernel

`hv6/spec/`:
    Contains the specification for the hv6 kernel

`irpy/compiler/`:
    Contains the implementation of the IR -> Python compiler used for
    symbolic execution

`irpy/libirpy/`:
    Contains the Python library and resources for performing symbolic
    execution over Python generated by the Irpy compiler

A few quick pointers:

- state-machine specification: `hv6/spec/kernel/spec/specs.py`
- declarative specification: `hv6/spec/kernel/spec/top.py`
